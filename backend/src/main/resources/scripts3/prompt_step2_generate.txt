Act as an expert Technical Recruiter and Hiring Manager. Generate a comprehensive list of 10 interview questions tailored specifically to this role.

The questions must cover these categories:
1.  **Introduction & Experience** (1-2 questions): standard opening but tailored to the JD.
2.  **Hard Skills & Technical Proficiency** (4-5 questions): deep dive into specific tools/languages mentioned in the JD.

For EACH question, provide a "Model Answer" or "Key Talking Points" that a candidate should mention to impress the interviewer.

Return the output as a RAW JSON list of objects with this exact structure:
[
  {{
    "question": "The interview question here...",
    "answer": "The ideal answer or key points to cover..."
  }},
  ...
]

Do not include markdown formatting (like ```json). Just the raw JSON.
